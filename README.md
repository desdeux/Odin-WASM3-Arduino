# Odin-WASM3-Arduino

Simple example of using Odin with wasm3 on ESP32.

To build, you will need to have `wasm-ld` in your odin compiler's bin folder and also `xxd` in your system path. Run build.bat and after open Wasm_Blink.ino in Arduino IDE, from where you can build and upload the firmware to ESP32.
